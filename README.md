# Hybrid_Movie_Recommender
Here I have implemented the concept of hybrid recommenders.I have used content based and collaborative based recommender to build my hybrid recommender.In content based recommender I have calculated cosine similarities to predict similarities between the movies and recommend similar movies based on cosine similarities.Now comes collaborative filter,in this I have used singular value decomposition to predict rating of all the unpredicted movies for every user in the dataset and recommends movie to a given user based on the predicted ratings.Now the final part is to build hybrid recommender based on both the recommenders,for this I have combined both the recommenders in the sequential order to get a desired result.
